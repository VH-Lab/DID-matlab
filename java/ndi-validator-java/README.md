This folder consists of all the source code tutorials, and the jar file for the java classes used by ../database/ndi_validate.m file. They are used to validate JSON file before storing them into the database. Use the following link the read the javadoc:

https://zhaoy17.github.io/javadoc-ndi-validator/

Note that if you want to make changes to the original java classes, you have to recompile the Java code and replace the jar file in the "DID-matlab/java/ndi-validator-java/jar/" folder with the newly compiled jar file. Updating the code in the source-code folder without recompilation will not change the behavior of the Java code.
